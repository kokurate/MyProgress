### apropos 
Tool that can be useful in the beginning is apropos. Each manual page has a short description available within it. This tool searches the descriptions for instances of a given keyword. just like help -help
```
kokurate@htb[/htb]$ apropos <keyword>

kokurate@htb[/htb]$ apropos sudo

sudo (8)             - execute a command as another user
sudo.conf (5)        - configuration for sudo front end
sudo_plugin (8)      - Sudo Plugin API
```
